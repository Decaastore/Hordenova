 * fast". This is a real simulation, not a guess — a greedy "always buy the
 * single cheapest available action, every tick" bot, which is the closest
 * automatable proxy for "a player who just levels everything" (build a
 * tower, level it, or now also choose/upgrade a specialization — whichever
 * is cheapest at that moment). It runs the ACTUAL GameEngine, not a
 * separate model, so this is load-bearing on real game code, not a
